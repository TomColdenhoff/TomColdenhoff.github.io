Hi, I’m **Tom Coldenhoff**, and I’m from the Netherlands. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technologies. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master’s in Business Informatics, continually expanding my understanding of how technology and business intertwine.

## Professional Background
I’m currently a backend developer with five years of experience in the tech industry. My journey began as an intern at a software agency, where I worked on a project that evolved into a startup, Altura.io. This startup garnered funding and became a significant milestone in my career, showcasing the potential of innovation.

## Why This Blog?
I created this blog out of a passion for sharing knowledge. Here, I delve into various topics, including tech, life, work, and studying. Occasionally, I also post programming tutorials and other tech-related guides. My goal is to provide additional perspectives and new knowledge to my readers.

## Outside of Work
When I’m not working on tech, you’ll find me traveling, playing tennis, reading, or enjoying a night out bar hopping. These activities offer a balance to life and often inspire fresh perspectives in my writing or undertakings.
